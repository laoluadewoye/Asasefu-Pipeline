1) Use Selenium to read my Ao3 casual collection catalog
2) Use Apache Storm and Spark to turn the series into a set of text chunks to save
3) Use Apache Storm and Spark to send the data to Apache Kafka and Hadoop
4) Use Apache Kafka to also send data to Hadoop
5) Use Hadoop to save things to files
6) Do everything inside containers

selenium/standalone-chrome docker image

docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 7900:7900 --shm-size="2g" selenium/standalone-chrome:136.0-20251101

------------------

Add a fuzzing random Ao3 link test to test suite.

Add CI/CD through Github Actions.

Add tests for chapter, story, and storyinfo classes

------------------

REST-based live update system in Spring Boot:

1) Client requests a parsing from the server through /api/v1/parse/chapter
2) Server creates a session id and stores it in a session management hashmap
3) Server starts a new thread for the parsing process attached to that session id.
4) New parsing thread has access to session management HashMap to update the progress.
5) Server returns a session id immediately to the client.
6) Client saves the session id in its own session management signal.
7) Client disables the starting of a new session until current session is done or canceled.
8) Client pings the server at intervals using /api/v1/parse/session/{sessionid}.
9) Client can cancel the session by using /api/v1/parse/session/{sessionid}/cancel.
9) Server checks the progress of the thread using updates to a shared session management hashmap.
10) Server sends the updated values of the session progress if not complete, including chapter progress and last message.
11) Server sends the final JSON string if complete. 
12) Server keeps the session in session management for a prespecified duration of time incase the client needs to get it again.
13) Client receives final message and saves the contents somewhere.
14) Client creates a dropdown for sessions completed and give the ability to nickname the session.
15) Client can click a session from dropdown and display it's contents.
16) The newest session is displayed immediately.
17) there is a save button for saving various stuff.

Angular frontend should be able to display:

* Section that allows user to enter required settings for parsing
	** What nickname do you want to call this parsing? (Optional Textbox)
	** Is the parsing going to be a single chapter or a full story? (Required Toggle)
	** What is the page link for this parsing? (Required Textbox, Needs Validation of URL and Ao3 address)
* Section for choosing processed chapters and stories
	** Tabular layout that switches between parsings, just storyinfos, and just chapters
	** On anything you can expand on complex structures such as objects and arrays
	** On any complex or atomic, you can select to download a json file of that object for safe keeping.
		*** Maybe also a yaml and xml file.
